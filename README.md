# Employee Tracker
Module 12 Challenge - Employee Tracker

In this challenge, I created a command-line application that met the following criteria:
<ul>When the application is started, the user is presented with several different options to choose from.</ul>
<ul>When the user chooses to view all departments, then they are presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids.</ul>
<ul>When the user chooses to view all roles, then they are presented with a formatted table showing job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role.</ul>
<ul>When the user chooses to view all employees, then they are presented with a formatted table showing employee first name, last name, employee id, job title, department, salary, and manager that the employee reports to.</ul>
<ul>When the user chooses to add a department, then they are prompted to enter the name of the department and it is added to the database.</ul>
<ul>When the user chooses to add a role, then they are prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and it is added to the database.</ul>
<ul>When the user chooses to add an employee, then they are prompted to enter the employee's first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database.</ul>
<ul>When the user chooses to update an employee, then they are prompted to select an employee id and put in their new role id, and it is added to the database.</ul>
